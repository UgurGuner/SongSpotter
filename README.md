In this project I have created a simple application showing the result of an api request through a spesific api link. I have used volley for the Rest API infrastructure. I have also used Kotlin coroutines, flows and LiveData to make the requests and also observe them. I have used Clean Architecture And MVVM together, I have combined them in simple terms in order to have a better structure. I have used Dagger-Hilt for dependency injection and Room Database for local storage which I have used that in tab 2, tab 3 and tab 4 of bottom navigation view which I also made that with navigation component library. I have turned build.gradle files from groovy to kotlin which also increases the performance of the app. I have created a smooth splash screen and also worked on and used a User Friendly UI. I have used Glide library for image loading.
